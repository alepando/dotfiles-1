#+PROPERTY: tangle ".emacs.d/init.el"
#+PROPERTY: mkdirp t

* Introduction
This file holds the relevant portion of my =.emacs.d=.  This includes
many different types of customizations, including
- my standardized, cross-platform initialization file and
- download and installation procedures for custom packages (those not
  on any ELPA).
Of course this list isn't comprehensive; this directory will hold
/everything/ that has to do with Emacs aside from the actual
distribution.  This /file/ will include everything it reasonably can.

All variables and functions that I introduce are prefixed with ~*-~ if
they are intended to be customized and ~*--~ if they are not so
intended.

** Creating the Directory
This directory is maintained both as an [[http://orgmode.org][Org]] file and its tangled
output.  Everything in the directory will be obtainable through this
file, whether it be from embedded shell scripts or standard, tangled
output.  With a recent Emacs installed, use =M-x org-babel-tangle= to
tangle the file.  This will create a Makefile and all of the necessary
Lisp files needed to fully reproduce this installation.

** Byte Compilation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(add-hook 'org-babel-post-tangle-hook
          (lambda () (interactive)
            (mapc 'byte-compile-file
                  '("init.el"))))
#+end_src

* A Multi-Platform Configuration
One of the things I like about Emacs is its consistent availability on
a variety of platforms---far more even than I've ever heard of.  I
mainly use
- Max OS X,
- Windows 7+, and
- Red Hat.
Do effect this, I use the variable ~system-type~.  These variables are
simply introduced to make code more readable.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq
 ,*--windows-p (equal system-type 'windows-nt)
 ,*--osx-p (equal system-type 'darwin)
 ,*--redhat-p (equal system-type 'gnu/linux))
#+end_src

If there ever is an occasion to toggle configuration based on the
current window system (or lack thereof), there is ~window-system~.

* File Management
** Creating Temporary Files
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun *-create-temporary-file (ext &optional prefix)
  "Creates a temporary file with EXT as the extension."
  (interactive "sExtension: ")
   (make-temp-file
    (concat "temp-file--" prefix) nil
    (concat "." ext)))

(defun *-find-temporary-file (ext &optional prefix)
  (interactive "sExtension: ")
  (find-file (*-create-temporary-file ext prefix)))

(global-set-key (kbd "C-x t") '*find--temporary-file)
#+end_src

* Package Management
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
  '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
  '("melpa" . "http://melpa.melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+end_src
#+begin_src elisp
(defun *-require-package (pkg)
  (let ((pkg (if (consp pkg) (car pkg) pkg))
        (ftr (if (consp pkg) (cdr pkg) pkg)))
    (when (not (package-installed-p pkg))
      (package-install pkg))
    (require ftr)))
      
(mapc #'*-require-package
      '(
        (auctex . latex)

        ))
#+end_src
* Customize
#+begin_src elisp
(setq custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory ".custom.el"))
#+end_src
** Fonts
These are default fonts.  The fonts I /use/ are properly customized.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defcustom *-text-sans-type
  "Arial"
  "The type to use for sans-serif body text."
  :group '*-fonts)

(defcustom *-text-serif-type
  "Georgia"
  "The type to use for sans-serif body text."
  :group '*-fonts)

(defcustom *-text-mono-type
  "Courier"
  "The type to use for sans-serif body text."
  :group '*-fonts)

(set-frame-font *-text-mono-type)
#+END_SRC
*** TODO add download instructions
*** TODO Use faces instead of strings
- then I'll be able to use different faces for text and ~code~.
* Keybindings
#+begin_src elisp
(defun *-with-map-bind-keys-to-functions (map ft-k-f)
  (when ft-k-f
    (let ((feature (caar ft-k-f))
          (keys (cadar ft-k-f))
          (func (caddar ft-k-f)))
 (mapc #'print (list feature keys func))
      (eval-after-load feature
        '(define-key map (kbd keys) (eval func)))
      (*-with-map-bind-keys-to-functions map (rest ft-k-f)))))

(defun *-after-feature-set-keys-to-functions (feature k-f)
  (when k-f
    (eval-after-load (if (and feature (not (booleanp feature)))
                         feature 'emacs)
      (prog1 t
        (global-set-key (kbd (caar k-f)) (eval (cadar k-f)))))
    (*-after-feature-set-keys-to-functions feature (rest k-f))))
#+end_src
** Magit
#+begin_src elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "M-?") #'magit-status)
#+end_src
** TeX
#+begin_src elisp
(*-with-map-bind-keys-to-functions
 TeX-mode-map
 '((latex "C-c t" #'*-TeX-find-texdoc)))
#+end_src
** C Modes
#+begin_src elisp
(*-with-map-bind-keys-to-functions
 c-mode-base-map
 '((find-file "C-c RET" #'ff-find-related-file)
   (cc-mode "C-c C-'" #'compile)))
#+end_src
** Multiple Cursors
#+begin_src elisp
(*-after-feature-set-keys-to-functions

 '(("C-M->" #'mc/mark-next-like-this)
   ("C-M-S-r" #'mc/mark-all-like-this-dwim)))
#+end_src

  (interactive)
  (isearch-yank-string (thing-at-point 'symbol)))
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src
* Magit
* [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][Snippets]]
=yasnippet= is a great way to manage mode-specific code snippets.
Since =yasnippet= has its own snippet creation workflow from within
emacs, they are not created here.

* [[https://github.com/chrisdone/god-mode][God Mode]]
Modal-editing the emacs way.  When in this minor mode, modifier keys
are more-or-less stripped away.  See [[https://github.com/chrisdone/god-mode][upstream]] for details.

These are the recommended settings.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'god-mode)
(global-set-key (kbd "<escape>") 'god-local-mode)

(defcustom *-god-mode-update-cursor-affected-forms
  '(god-local-mode buffer-read-only)
  "If any of these forms evaluate to non-nil, the cursor will change."
  :group '*-god)

(defcustom *-god-mode-update-cursor-cursor
  'hbar
  "The cursor to use"
  :group '*-god)

(defun *--god-mode-update-cursor ()
  (setq cursor-type
        (if (member t (mapcar #'eval *-god-mode-update-cursor-affected-forms))
            ,*-god-mode-update-cursor-cursor t)))

#+END_SRC
* TeX
TeX is a typesetting system that produces documents of high quality
and typographical consistency.  I'm a heavy user of this system under
AUCTeX and RefTeX, two of the most indispensible resources available
for TeX under emacs.

** Finding Documentation with TeXdoc
=texdoc= is an application that comes with most TeX distributions.
This function brings them up within emacs.
#+begin_src elisp
(defcustom *-TeX-find-texdoc-temp-file-format
  "TeX-find-texdoc--%s--"
  "The prefix for temporary files created with `*-TeX-find-texdoc'"
  :group '*-tex)

(defun *-TeX-find-texdoc (texdoc-query)
  (interactive "sPackage: ")
  (if (string-equal texdoc-query "")
      (error "Cannot query texdoc against an empty string")
    (let ((texdoc-output (shell-command-to-string
                          (format "texdoc -l -M %s"
                                  texdoc-query))))
      (if (string-match texdoc-output "")
          (error "Sorry, no documentation found for %s" texdoc-query)
        (let ((texdoc-file (nth 2 (split-string texdoc-output))))
          (if (file-readable-p texdoc-file)
              (let ((new-file (*-create-temporary-file
                               "pdf"
                               (format *-TeX-find-texdoc-temp-file-format
                                       texdoc-query
                                       texdoc-file))))
                (copy-file texdoc-file new-file t)
                (find-file-other-window new-file))
            (error "Sorry, the file returned by texdoc for %s isn't readable"
                   texdoc-query)))))))

* Custom File
** TODO Setting a Custom Custom File
Emacs is famous for its customizability.  There are many, many
variables that directly support being customized with =custom.el=.
All of these variables can visually clog up the initialization file if
they are included there.

Fortunately, Emacs supports the customization of where all of these
customizations are stored.  (A little nuts, right?)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;(load
 (setq custom-file ".emacs-custom.el");)
#+end_src
Remember: the ~set~ family of functions returns the value that the
variable was set to.

** Customizations
Since it would be unreasonable to set up a system by which =custom.el=
would edit the Org source file for its customizations, I've decided to
track these customizations in its own file.  Sorry to disappoint!

If anything interesting comes up, explanations will be placed here.
