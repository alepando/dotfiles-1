#+Title: Emacs Customizations

* Introduction
This file holds the relevant portion of my =.emacs.d=.  This includes
many different types of customizations:
- standard initialization file,
- customizations (via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization][Custom]]), and
- download and installation procedures for custom packages.
Of course this list isn't comprehensive; this directory will hold
/everything/ that has to do with Emacs aside from the actual
distribution.

** Creating the Directory
This directory is maintained both as an [[http://orgmode.org][Org]] file and its tangled
output.  Everything in the directory will be obtainable through this
file, whether it be from embedded shell scripts or standard, tangled
output.  With a recent Emacs installed, use =M-x org-babel-tangle= to
tangle the file.  This will create a Makefile and all of the necessary
Lisp files needed to fully reproduce this installation.
